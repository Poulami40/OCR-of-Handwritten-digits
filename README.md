# OCR-of-Handwritten-digits
Utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of handwritten digits involves a straightforward yet effective approach. The KNN algorithm classifies an input image of a handwritten digit by comparing it with a set of labeled training images. Each training image is associated with a specific digit label. The KNN algorithm computes the distances between the pixel values of the input image and those of the training images. It then selects the K nearest training images based on the computed distances. The digit label that appears most frequently among the K neighbors is assigned as the OCR prediction for the input image. This method leverages the simplicity of KNN and its ability to handle image classification tasks, making it a suitable choice for recognizing handwritten digits in OCR applications.
